in recent trend in world wide Lockdowns due to COVID19 outbreak, as Face Mask is became mandatory for everyone while roaming outside, approach of Deep Learning for Detecting Faces With and Without mask were a good trendy practice. Here I have created a model that detects face mask trained on 7553 images with 3 color channels (RGB).

If your priority is efficiency and lightweight models for mobile or edge devices, MobileNetV2 is the clear winner. On the other hand, if accuracy and performance on high-powered systems are critical, ResNet152V2 may be a better choice.
